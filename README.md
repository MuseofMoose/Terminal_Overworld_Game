# Terminal_Overworld_Game

One of my first projects at wyncode. It's a simple, array-based, repl overworld "game". There are objects in the world,
but most of them don't do anything yet. "Collision detection" works perfectly fine and the world boundaries have
been appropriately coded.

Future plans (if I ever get the time to come back to this) involve implementing an auto-world-generator(which
I've already built), adding "enemies" with very basic ai (enemy creation is there, but the ai needs to be made).
and adding mini-game triggers to some of the overworld objects (one of them triggers a text-based story thing,
but I'd like to add more diverse scenarios).

As simple and ugly as it currently may be, it's probably the project that's closest to my heart. :3
